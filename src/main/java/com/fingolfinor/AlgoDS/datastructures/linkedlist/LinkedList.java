package com.fingolfinor.AlgoDS.datastructures.linkedlist;


/**
 * A FIFO DS that chains Nodes together through a Container that manages the List through the Head (first Node). Each
 * Node has Data and a Next value that points to the next Node in the chain. Often suited for Queue related problems
 * because the List is always accessed in order, from first to last (FIFO).
 *
 * Pros-Cons:
 * + Dynamic sizing and fast O(n) inserting/deleting Nodes
 * - Slow access reading when N gets big since scan from Head to Tail
 * - Memory vs array since next pointer takes an additional 4-Bytes
 *
 * Q & A:
 * Q. Is there a standard interface? e.g. no Insert After key?
 * A. ...
 * 
 * TODO:
 * * Implement Interface from these instructions
 *      https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~adamchik/15-121/lectures/Linked%20Lists/linked%20lists.html
